This is a small repo, used for testing different ansible configurations... You can fork this repo, but just remember to change your inventory/hosts file so ansible knows about YOUR servers rather than mine :)
You can use a dynamic inventory as well. At the moment I am not because I have no need for this but I may add something in the future. There are example dynamic inventory files in the ansible git repo.
